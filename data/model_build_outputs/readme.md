This folder should contain outputs that you write when during and after running `model-build`.

This folder will be accessible when running the `model-apply` phase.

The output files can be anything you need for your `model-apply` phase.

As an example, a trained neural network (from Tensorflow) might be saved as `my-model.h5` to be used during the `model-apply` phase.
